      <p>
        The industry standard format, for data coming off a clinical
    imaging device, is
        <a href="http://dicom.nema.org">
          DICOM
        </a>
        (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine).  The DICOM
    &quot;standard&quot; is very broad and very complicated.  Roughly speaking
    each DICOM-compliant file is a collection of fields organized into
    two four-byte sequences (group,element) that are represented as
    hexadecimal numbers and form a
        <em>
          tag
        </em>.  The (group,element)
    combination announces what type of information is coming next.
    There is no fixed number of bytes for a DICOM header.  The final
    (group,element) tag should be the &quot;data&quot; tag (7FE0,0010), such
    that all subsequent information is related to the image(s).

      <p>
        Although the industry standard for medical imaging data is
    DICOM, another format has come to be heavily used in the image
    analysis community.  The ANALYZE
    format was originally developed in conjunction with an image
    processing system (of the same name) at the Mayo Foundation.  An
    Anlayze (7.5) format image is comprised of two files, the &quot;hdr&quot;
    and &quot;img&quot; files, that contain information about the acquisition
    and the acquisition itself, respectively.  A more recent adaption
    of this format is known as
        <a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1">
          NIfTI-1
        </a>
        and is a
    product of the Data Format Working Group (DFWG) from the
    Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI).  The
    NIfTI-1 data format is almost identical to the ANALYZE format, but
    offers a few improvements: merging of the header and image
    information into one file (.nii), re-organization of the 348-byte
    fixed header into more relevant categories and the possibility of
    extending the header information.

      contrast-agent concentration and kinetic parameter estimation.
      Parametric estimation of the kinetic parameters, from a

          contains R functions for estimating the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, based on adaptive Gauss Markov random fields, for real as well as simulated data.  Inference of the underlying models is performed by efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, with the Metropolis Hastings algorithm for the non-approximate case and the Gibbs sampler for the approximate case.  When comparing the results of approximate to the non-approximate version the outcome is in favour of the former, as the gain of accuracy in estimation, when not approximating, is minimal and the computational burden becomes less cumbersome.

          The
<a href="../packages/occ/index.html">occ</a>
          package provides a generic function for
      estimating PET neuro-receptor occupancies by a drug, from the
      total volumes of distribution of a set of regions of interest
      (ROI).  Fittings methods include the reference region, the
          <em>
            ordinary least squares
          </em>
          (OLS, sometimes known as
      &quot;occupancy plot&quot;) and the
          <em>
            restricted maximum likelihood
      estimation
          </em>
          (REML).

        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/PET/index.html">PET</a>
          package contains three of the major
      iterative reconstruction techniques (Algebraic Reconstruction
      Technique, Likelihood Reconstruction using Expectation
      Maximization and Least Squares Conjugate Method) and several
      direct reconstruction methods for radon transformed data.
      Furthermore, it offers the possibility to simulate a marked
      Poisson process with spatial varying intensity.

          The EEG package (currently only available within the
<a href="https://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/eeg/"><span class="Rforge">eeg</span></a>
          project on R-Forge) reads in single trial
      EEG (currently only ascii-exported pre-processed and trial
      segmented in Brain Vision Analyzer), computes averages (i.e.,
      event-related potentials or ERP's) and stores ERP's from
      multiple data sets in a
          <tt>
            data.frame
          </tt>
          like object, such
      that statistical analysis (linear model, (M)ANOVA) can be done
      using the familiar R modeling frame work.

        <li>
<a href="../packages/eegkit/index.html">eegkit</a>
          includes many useful functions for analysing EEG signals (among others, visualizing positions of electrodes).
        </li>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/PTAk/index.html">PTAk</a>
          is an R package that uses a multiway method
      to decompose a tensor (array) of any order, as a generalisation
      of a singular value decomposition (SVD) also supporting
      non-identity metrics and penalisations.  A 2-way SVD with these
      extensions is also available.  The package also includes
      additional multiway methods: PCAn (Tucker-n) and
      PARAFAC/CANDECOMP with these extensions.  Applications include
      the analysis of EEG and functional MRI data.
