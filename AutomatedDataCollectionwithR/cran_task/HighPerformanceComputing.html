      <p>
        This CRAN task view contains a list of packages, grouped by topic, that
      are useful for high-performance computing (HPC) with R.  In this context, we
      are defining 'high-performance computing' rather loosely as just about anything
      related to pushing R a little further: using compiled code,
      parallel computing (in both explicit and implicit modes), working with
      large objects as well as profiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise mentioned, all packages presented with hyperlinks 
      are available from CRAN, the
      Comprehensive R Archive Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several of the areas discussed in this Task View are undergoing rapid
      change. Please send suggestions for additions and extensions for this task
      view to the

        The
<tt>ctv</tt>
        package supports these Task Views. Its functions
<tt>install.views</tt>
        and
<tt>update.views</tt>
        allow,
      respectively, installation or update of packages from a given Task View;
      the option
<tt>coreOnly</tt>
        can restrict operations to packages labeled as
        <em>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Direct support in R started with release 2.14.0
        </strong>
        which includes a new package
        <strong>
          parallel
        </strong>
        incorporating 
      (slightly revised) copies of packages multicore and
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>.  Some types of clusters are not handled directly by 
      the base package 'parallel'. However, and as explained in the package
      vignette, the parts of parallel which provide
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>
        -like functions will
      accept
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>
        clusters including MPI clusters. Use
<tt>vignette(&quot;parallel&quot;)</tt>
        to view the package vignette.
<br/>
        The
        <strong>
          parallel
        </strong>
        package also contains support for multiple 
      RNG streams following L'Ecuyer et al (2002), with support for 
      both mclapply and snow clusters.
<br/>
        The version released for R 2.14.0 contains base functionality:
      higher-level convenience functions are planned for later R releases.

          Parallel computing: Explicit parallelism
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Several packages provide the communications layer required for parallel
	computing. The first package in this area was
	rpvm by Li and Rossini which uses the PVM (Parallel Virtual
	Machine) standard and libraries. rpvm is no longer actively
	maintained, but available from its CRAN archive directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          In recent years, the
        alternative MPI (Message Passing Interface) standard has become the
        de facto standard in parallel computing. It is supported in R via
  	the
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
          by Yu.
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
          package is mature yet actively
	maintained and offers access to numerous functions from the MPI
	API, as well as a number of R-specific extensions.
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
          can be used with the LAM/MPI, MPICH / MPICH2, Open MPI, and Deino MPI 
        implementations. It should be noted that LAM/MPI is now in
        maintenance mode, and new development is focused on Open MPI.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/pbdMPI/index.html">pbdMPI</a>
          package provides S4 classes to directly interface 
        MPI in order to support the Single Program/Multiple Data (SPMD) parallel 
        programming style which is particularly useful for batch parallel execution.
	The
<a href="../packages/pbdSLAP/index.html">pbdSLAP</a>
          builds on this and uses scalable linear algebra 
	packages (namely BLACS, PBLAS, and ScaLAPACK) in double precision based 
	on ScaLAPACK version 2.0.2. 
	The
<a href="../packages/pbdBASE/index.html">pbdBASE</a>
          builds on these and provides the core classes
        and methods for distributed data types upon which the
<a href="../packages/pbdDMAT/index.html">pbdDMAT</a>
          builds to provide distributed dense matrices for &quot;Programming 
	with Big Data&quot;. The
<a href="../packages/pbdNCDF4/index.html">pbdNCDF4</a>
          package permits
	multiple processes to write to the same file (without manual
	synchronization) and supports terabyte-sized files.
	The
<a href="../packages/pbdDEMO/index.html">pbdDEMO</a>
          package provides examples for these
	packages, and a detailed vignette.
        The
<a href="../packages/pbdPROF/index.html">pbdPROF</a>
          package profiles MPI communication SPMD code
        via MPI profiling libraries, such as fpmpi, mpiP, or TAU.
        </li>
        <li>
          An alternative is provided by the
<a href="../packages/nws/index.html">nws</a>
          (NetWorkSpaces)
        packages from REvolution Computing. It is the successor to the
	earlier LindaSpaces approach to parallel computing, and is
	implemented on top of the Twisted networking toolkit for Python.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>
          (Simple Network of Workstations) package by
        Tierney et al. can use PVM, MPI, NWS as well as direct networking
        sockets. It provides an abstraction layer by hiding the
	communications details. The
<a href="../packages/snowFT/index.html">snowFT</a>
          package provides 
        fault-tolerance extensions to
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/snowfall/index.html">snowfall</a>
          package by Knaus provides a more recent
	alternative to
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>. Functions can be used in sequential or
	parallel mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/foreach/index.html">foreach</a>
          package allows general iteration over
	elements in a collection without the use of an explicit loop
	counter. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates
	executing the loop in parallel which is possible via
	the
<a href="../packages/doMC/index.html">doMC</a>
          (using parallel/multicore on single
	workstations),
<a href="../packages/doSNOW/index.html">doSNOW</a>
          (using
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>, see
	above),
<a href="../packages/doMPI/index.html">doMPI</a>
          (using
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>) packages,
<a href="../packages/doFuture/index.html">doFuture</a>

<a href="../packages/future/index.html">future</a>
          or
<a href="../packages/future.BatchJobs/index.html">future.BatchJobs</a>), and
<a href="../packages/doRedis/index.html">doRedis</a>
          (using
<a href="../packages/rredis/index.html">rredis</a>) packages.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/future/index.html">future</a>
          package allows for synchronous (sequential)
        and asynchronous (parallel) evaluations via abstraction of futures,
        either via function calls or implicitly via promises. Global variables
        are automatically identified. Iteration over elements in a collection
        is supported.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/Rborist/index.html">Rborist</a>
          package employs OpenMP pragmas to exploit 
        predictor-level parallelism in the Random Forest algorithm which
        promotes efficient use of multicore hardware in restaging data and in 
        determining splitting criteria, both of which are performance 
        bottlenecks in the algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/h2o/index.html">h2o</a>
          package connects to the h2o open source machine
        learning environment which has scalable implementations of random
        forests, GBM, GLM (with elastic net regularization), and deep learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/randomForestSRC/index.html">randomForestSRC</a>
          package can use both OpenMP as well
        as MPI for random forest extensions suitable for survival analysis,
        competing risks analysis, classification as well as regression
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/parSim/index.html">parSim</a>
          package can perform simulation studies using
        one or multiple cores, both locally and on HPC clusters.
        </li>

        <strong>
          Parallel computing: Implicit parallelism
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The pnmath package by Tierney 
	(
          <a href="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/experimental/">
            link
          </a>)
	uses the Open MP parallel processing directives of recent compilers
        (such gcc 4.2 or later) for implicit parallelism by replacing a
        number of internal R functions with replacements that can make use of
        multiple cores --- without any explicit requests from the user.  The
        alternate pnmath0 package offers the same functionality using
        Pthreads for environments in which the newer compilers are not
        available.  Similar functionality is expected to become integrated
        into R 'eventually'.
        </li>
        <li>
          The romp package by Jamitzky was presented at useR! 2008

        </li>
        <li>
          The R/parallel package by Vera, Jansen and Suppi offers a C++-based master-slave dispatch
        mechanism for parallel execution (
