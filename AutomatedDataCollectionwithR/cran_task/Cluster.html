        This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages that can be
used for finding groups in data and modeling unobserved
cross-sectional heterogeneity. Many packages provide functionality for
more than one of the topics listed below, the section headings are
mainly meant as quick starting points rather than an ultimate
categorization. Except for packages stats and cluster (which ship with
base R and hence are part of every R installation), each package is
listed only once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the packages listed in this CRAN Task View, but not all are
distributed under the GPL. Please have a look at the DESCRIPTION file
of each package to check under which license it is distributed.
