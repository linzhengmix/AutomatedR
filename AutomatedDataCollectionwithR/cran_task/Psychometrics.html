      Psychometrics is concerned with theory and techniques of psychological measurement.
Psychometricians have also worked collaboratively with those in the field of statistics and
quantitative methods to develop improved ways to organize, analyze, and scale
corresponding data. Since much functionality is already contained in base R and there
is considerable overlap between tools for psychometry and tools
described in other views, particularly in
<a href="SocialSciences.html">SocialSciences</a>,
we only give a brief overview of packages that are closely related to
psychometric methodology.
