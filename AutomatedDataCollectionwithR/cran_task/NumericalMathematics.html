      <p>
        This task view on numerical mathematics lists R packages and functions 
    that are useful for solving numerical problems in linear algebra and 
    analysis. It shows that R is a viable computing environment for 
    implementing and applying numerical methods, also outside the realm of 
    statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task view will
        <em>
          not
        </em>
        cover differential equations, 
    optimization problems and solvers, or packages and functions operating 
    on times series, because all these topics are treated extensively in 
    the corresponding task views
<a href="DifferentialEquations.html">DifferentialEquations</a>,
<a href="Optimization.html">Optimization</a>, and
<a href="TimeSeries.html">TimeSeries</a>.
    All these task views together will provide a good selection of what is
    available in R for the area of numerical mathematics.
    The
<a href="HighPerformanceComputing.html">HighPerformanceComputing</a>
        task view with its many
    links for parallel computing may also be of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task view has been created to provide an overview of the topic. 
    If some packages are missing or certain topics in numerical math 
    should be treated in more detail, please let the maintainer know.

          Numerical Linear Algebra
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As statistics is based to a large extent on linear algebra, many 
    numerical linear algebra routines are present in R, and some only 
    implicitly. Examples of explicitly available functions are vector and 
    matrix operations, matrix (QR) decompositions, solving linear equations, 
    eigenvalues/-vectors, singular value decomposition, or least-squares 
    approximation.
