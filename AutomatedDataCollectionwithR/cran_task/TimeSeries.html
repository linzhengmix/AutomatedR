      <p>
        Base R ships with a lot of functionality useful for time series, in particular in the stats package. This is complemented by many packages on CRAN, which are briefly summarized below. There is also a considerable overlap between the tools for time series and those in the
<a href="Econometrics.html">Econometrics</a>
        and
<a href="Finance.html">Finance</a>
        task views. The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics. If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let us know.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Basics
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>
            Infrastructure
          </i>:
    Base R contains substantial infrastructure for representing and analyzing time series data. The fundamental class is
<tt>&quot;ts&quot;</tt>
          that can represent regularly spaced time series (using numeric time stamps). Hence, it is particularly well-suited for annual, monthly, quarterly data, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Rolling statistics
          </i>:
    Moving averages are computed by
<tt>ma</tt>
          from
<a href="../packages/forecast/index.html">forecast</a>, and
<tt>rollmean</tt>
          from
<a href="../packages/zoo/index.html">zoo</a>. The latter also provides a general function
<tt>rollapply</tt>, along with other specific rolling statistics functions.
<a href="../packages/roll/index.html">roll</a>
          provides parallel functions for computing rolling statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Graphics
          </i>:
    Time series plots are obtained with
<tt>plot()</tt>
          applied to
<tt>ts</tt>
          objects.
    (Partial) autocorrelation functions plots are implemented in
<tt>acf()</tt>
          and
<tt>pacf()</tt>. Alternative versions are provided by
<tt>Acf()</tt>
          and
<tt>Pacf()</tt>
          in
<a href="../packages/forecast/index.html">forecast</a>, along with a combination display using
<tt>tsdisplay()</tt>.
<a href="../packages/SDD/index.html">SDD</a>
          provides more general serial dependence diagrams, while
<a href="../packages/dCovTS/index.html">dCovTS</a>
          computes and plots the distance covariance and correlation functions of time series.
    Seasonal displays are obtained using
<tt>monthplot()</tt>
          in stats and
<tt>seasonplot</tt>
          in
<a href="../packages/forecast/index.html">forecast</a>.
<a href="../packages/Wats/index.html">Wats</a>
          implements wrap-around time series graphics.
<a href="../packages/ggseas/index.html">ggseas</a>
          provides ggplot2 graphics for seasonally adjusted series and rolling statistics.
<a href="../packages/dygraphs/index.html">dygraphs</a>
          provides an interface to the Dygraphs interactive time series charting library.
<a href="../packages/TSstudio/index.html">TSstudio</a>
          provides some interactive visualization tools for time series.
<a href="../packages/ZRA/index.html">ZRA</a>
          plots forecast objects from the
<a href="../packages/forecast/index.html">forecast</a>
          package using dygraphs.
    Basic fan plots of forecast distributions are provided by
<a href="../packages/forecast/index.html">forecast</a>
          and

        <li>
          Class
<tt>&quot;ts&quot;</tt>
          can only deal with numeric time stamps, but many more classes are available for storing time/date information and computing with it.

        <li>
          Classes
<tt>&quot;yearmon&quot;</tt>

          from
<a href="../packages/zoo/index.html">zoo</a>
          allow for more convenient computation with monthly and quarterly observations, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Class
<tt>&quot;Date&quot;</tt>
          from the base package is the basic class for dealing with dates in daily data. The dates are internally stored as the number of days since 1970-01-01.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/chron/index.html">chron</a>
          package
    provides classes for
<tt>dates()</tt>,
<tt>hours()</tt>
          and date/time (intra-day) in
<tt>chron()</tt>.
    There is no support for time zones and daylight savings time.
    Internally,
<tt>&quot;chron&quot;</tt>
          objects are (fractional) days since 1970-01-01.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classes
<tt>&quot;POSIXct&quot;</tt>
          and
<tt>&quot;POSIXlt&quot;</tt>
          implement the POSIX standard for date/time (intra-day) information and also support time zones and daylight savings time.
    However, the time zone computations require some care and might be system-dependent.
    Internally,
<tt>&quot;POSIXct&quot;</tt>
          objects are the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT.
    Package
<a href="../packages/lubridate/index.html">lubridate</a>

<a href="../packages/timeDate/index.html">timeDate</a>
          package (previously: fCalendar).
    It is aimed at financial time/date information and deals with time zones and daylight savings times via a new concept of &quot;financial centers&quot;.
    Internally, it stores all information in
<tt>&quot;POSIXct&quot;</tt>
          and does all computations in GMT only.
    Calendar functionality, e.g., including information about weekends and holidays for various stock exchanges, is also included.
